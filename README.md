Hikar Webapp
============

This is the repository for the [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) based Hikar web app, which aims to port the [Hikar](https://hikar.org) Android app to the web. 

Now with inbuilt Node.js server meaning you can install the Hikar webapp in one go! An OSM PostGIS database is needed.
