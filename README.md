Hikar Webapp
============


This is the repository for the [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js) based Hikar web app, which aims to port the [Hikar](https://hikar.org) Android app to the web. 

Now with inbuilt Node.js server meaning you can install the Hikar webapp in one go! An OSM PostGIS database is needed.

### IMPORTANT!

Please see the `locar` branch for development (only just started) of a re-implemented version with [LocAR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/locar.js) and [RDK](https://github.com/omnidotdev/rdk). This version will not see updates, other than bug-fixes.
